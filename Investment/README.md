# Document Description

My Power BI project is based on data provided during a course. The report works with investment data from various companies. We can see the visualizations in line charts, bar charts and clear comparisons in matrices. In this project, I created several new tables, some of which are using Power BI parameters. I also created some new measures using DAX functions for calculations, analysis and dynamic headlines.

## Example of used tables
